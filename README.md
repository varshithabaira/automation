Starting Our Agentic AI-Powered Automation Journey at Innomatics Research Labs
I’m thrilled to share my recent project Automated Sentiment-Based Email Responder — an intelligent agentic workflow automation system built on n8n.
Workflow:
Google Sheets Trigger → AI Sentiment Analysis → Smart Email Responses
Our agentic AI system can now:
 1: Monitor incoming feedback from Google Forms (stored in Google Sheets)
 2: Analyze sentiment using the Google Gemini Chat Model
 3: Autonomously decide and send personalized email responses based on sentiment classification (Positive / Negative)
This marks just the beginning of our journey into agentic AI-driven process automation. The possibilities are endless when we bring together:
 Real-time data processing
 Advanced AI models with autonomous reasoning
 Intelligent agentic workflows that act independently
 Self-directing systems that adapt and respond dynamically
 Huge gratitude to Vishwanath Vishwanath Nyathani, Raghu Ram Aduri, and SAXON K SHA for giving us the opportunity to explore these cutting-edge technologies.
Special thanks to Innomatics Research Labs for fostering an environment where innovation and experimentation with agentic AI truly thrive.
This is just the start of transforming manual processes into intelligent, autonomous agentic systems — and I’m excited to see where this journey leads next!
